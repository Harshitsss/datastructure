            HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content. With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed tags.

When a web browser reads an HTML document, browser reads it from top to bottom and left to right. HTML tags are used to create HTML documents and render their properties. Each HTML tags have different properties.

An HTML file must have some essential tags so that web browser can differentiate between a simple text and HTML text. You can use as many tags you want as per your code requirement.

All HTML tags must enclosed within < > these brackets.
Every tag in HTML perform different tasks.
If you have used an open tag <>, then you must use a close tag </> (except some tags)<br>

    <h4>Table</h4>
    HTML table tag is used to display data in tabular form (row * column). There can be many columns in a row.

We can create a table to display data in tabular form, using <u>table</u>element, with the help of <u>tr</u> ,<u>td></u>, and <u>th</u> elements.

In Each table, table row is defined by <u>tr</u>tag, table header is defined by <u>th</u>, and table data is defined by<u>td</u> tags.

HTML tables are used to manage the layout of the page e.g. header section, navigation bar, body content, footer section etc. 
But it is recommended to use div tag over table to manage the layout of the page<br>
<h4>Attributes of Table</h4>
<h5>align</h5>
This enumerated attribute indicates how the table must be aligned inside the containing document. It may have the following values:

left: the table is displayed on the left side of the document;
center: the table is displayed in the center of the document;
right: the table is displayed on the right side of the document.
Set margin-left and margin-right to auto or margin to 0 auto to achieve an effect that is similar to the align attribute.<br>

<h5>Bgcolor</h5>
The background color of the table. It is a 6-digit hexadecimal RGB code, prefixed by a '#'. One of the predefined color keywords can also be used.

<br>

<h5> border</h5>
This integer attribute defines, in pixels, the size of the frame surrounding the table. If set to 0, the frame attribute is set to void.

<br>

<h5>Cell padding</h5>
This attribute defines the space between the content of a cell and its border, displayed or not. If the cellpadding's length is defined in pixels, this pixel-sized space will be applied to all four sides of the cell's content. If the length is defined using a percentage value, the content will be centered and the total vertical space (top and bottom) will represent this value. The same is true for the total horizontal space (left and right).

<br>

<h5>cell spacing</h5>
This attribute defines the size of the space between two cells in a percentage value or pixels. The attribute is applied both horizontally and vertically, to the space between the top of the table and the cells of the first row, the left of the table and the first column, the right of the table and the last column and the bottom of the table and the last row.
<br>
<h5>Frame</h5>
This  attribute defines which side of the frame surrounding the table must be displayed.

    <h4> hyper link</h4>
    HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document.

When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.
The <u>a</u> tag comes in pairs, the opening <u>a</u> tells where the link should start and the closing <u>a</u>indicates where the link ends.

To create a hyperlink, you should use the <u>a</u> tag and href attribute, the value of which is the URL, or location, where the link is pointing to.<br>
