        <h3>About Javascript</h3>
        <p>
<h4> What is Javascript</h4>
JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) 
we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. <br>

            <h5>Variables</h5>
            Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).<br>

            <h5>Data Type</h5>
            A data type in JavaScript is a container that stores a specific type of data.<br>
             Datatypes<br>
1. String<br>
2. Number<br>
3. Boolean<br>
 4.Undefined<br>
 5.Null<br>
 6.Object<br>

            <h4> Operators</h4>
            Operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more.<br>

There are different types of JavaScript operators:<br>

Arithmetic Operators<br>
Assignment Operators<br>
Comparison Operators<br>
Logical Operators<br>
Conditional Operators<br>
bitwise Operators<br>

        <h4>Control Statement</h4>
        Javascript control statement is used to control the flow of program based on the specified condition.<br>

        control statements:<br>
1. If Statement<br>
2. If else statement<br>
3. if else if statement<br>

       <h5>If statement</h5>
       If statement is used to execute a block of statements if specified condition is true.
       <br>

      <br>
      <h5>If Else statement</h5>
      If else statement is used to execute either of two block of statements depends upon the condition. 
      If condition is true then if block will execute otherwise else block will execute.<br>

      <br>
      <h5>If Else If statement</h5>
      If else statement is used to execute one block of statements from many depends upon the condition.
       If condition1 is true then block of statements1 will be executed, else if condition2 is true block of statements2 is executed and so on. 
      If no condition is true, then else block of statements will be executed.<br>

       <h5>Switch Statement</h5>
       The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
       Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.<br>
       This is how it works:<br>

The switch expression is evaluated once.<br>
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.<br>
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.<br>
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.<br>
<u>The break Keyword</u><br>
When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.
This will stop the execution inside the switch block.
It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. The block breaks (ends) there anyway.<br>

   <h4>Loop</h4>
   Loops can execute a block of code a number of times. 
   if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
   <h5> Different Type of loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:<br>
<h5>FOR Loop</h5>
loops through a block of code a number of times
<br>

<h5>while</h5>
loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
<br>
<h5>do/while </h5>
also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
<br>
<h4> The For Loop</h4>
The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:<br>

<br>
<h4> while Loop</h4>
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.<br>
<img src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.6zFGYVtVaDN0nJLXec9xbQHaCu&pid=Api&P=0" width="30%" height="30%"><br>
<br>
<h4>Do while loop</h4>
The do while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true,
 then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.<br>

 <h4>Function</h4>
 A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).<br>

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:<br>
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)<br>

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}<br>

<h4>Object</h4>
Objects also a type of variable. But objects can contain many values.
The values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
The named values, in JavaScript objects, are called properties.<br>

<h4>Events</h4>
HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.<br>
When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.
An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:<br>

An HTML web page has finished loading<br>
An HTML input field was changed<br>
An HTML button was clicked<br>
Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.<br>

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.<br>

HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.<br>
<h5> Some Comamon Events</h5>
<h5>onchange</h5>	An HTML element has been changed
<br>
<h5>onclick</h5>	The user clicks an HTML element
<br>
<h5>onmouseover</h5>	The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
<br>
<h5>onmouseout</h5>	The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
<br>
<h5>onkeydown</h5>	The user pushes a keyboard key
<br>
<h5>onload</h5>
	The browser has finished loading the page
